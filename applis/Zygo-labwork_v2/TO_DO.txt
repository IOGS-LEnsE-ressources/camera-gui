-->   Delete wrapped and unwrapped calculations if mask changed
-->   Masks upgrade and display
-->   Remove access to mask mode if no pictures
-->   Saving images (histo or AOI) : stop camera acquisition !

-->   Multiple acquisition : Mean on a set of images + display !!
        - display PV and RMS for each set of data
