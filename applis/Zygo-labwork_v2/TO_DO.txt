## ZYGO v2 APP
==============

/!\ MODIFICATION OF NI_DAQ CLASS !


### Things to check
-------------------
-->   Classe AberrationsChoiceWidget for select aberrations to compensate (to do)


### Bugs to delete
------------------
-->   Delete wrapped and unwrapped calculations if mask changed
-->   Masks upgrade and display
-->   Saving images (histo or AOI) : stop camera acquisition !

-->   Images (mode) - delete "Delete image" ?
                    - move "Save images" to Acquisition !

### Functions to add
--------------------

-->   Multiple acquisition : Mean on a set of images + display !!
        - display PV and RMS for each set of data
        - display global PV and RMS and mean / std for sets
        - display an unwrapped figure for each acquisition

-->   Display of PV and RMS in simple analysis (without Stats Table !)
