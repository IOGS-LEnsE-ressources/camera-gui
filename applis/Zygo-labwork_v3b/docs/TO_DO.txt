DONE : Acquisition, Images, Masks, Analyses

-->     If new acquisition or new data, erase zernike coeff ! And restart analyses

Functions
=========
-->     GLOBAL : Hardware - default values for camera and piezo to update
            if hardware is connected
-->     Save mask type in MAT file (and read it)
-->     Analyses mode / view : add 3D option !
-->     Display PV/RMS in lambda and meters (nm)


Bugs
====
-->     When clicking on simple_analysis_button, another window opened and disapeared...

-->     GLOBAL / Freeze and crash when open images then go to analyses (via masks or not)

-->     Frame Rate increase !!

-->     main menu management - and options list !
            + if no mask in the data loaded, Masks in main menu is not available
-->     in acquisition controllers (and global)
            + find a way to update DEFAULT parameters (for camera and piezo)
            + find a way to stop thread_update camera on closing acquisition mode
-->     in masks controllers / options view
            + in update_submenu : update 'nomask' in options_list of manager
-->     in analyses controller
            + unwrapped -> display wrapped and unwrapped in 3D

-->     GLOBAL TEST
            +> main_menu
            +> acquisition mode
                + !! CAMERA !! when starting in CMD shell :
                        QObject::startTimer: Timers cannot be started from another thread
                + update default values to camera/piezo parameters
                + update camera parameters when slider changed
                + when clicking from camera submode to other submode (simple, piezo...) :
                        thread_image / acquisition mode / Error-Code: 13 (PEAK_RETURN_CODE_TIMEOUT)
            +> images mode
                + when deleting a mask (in masks mode) then back to images mode,
                access to images is not possible (bar with buttons is deleted)
            +> masks mode
            +> analyses mode
                + when back to analyses mode (if coeffs already calculated), no access to corrected phase
                and progress bar to 0

Test to do
==========
-> Save set of images (with multi acquisition)
-> Display images from multi sets
