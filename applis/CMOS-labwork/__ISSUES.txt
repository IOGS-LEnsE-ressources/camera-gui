===================

NOT TESTED WITH BASLER CAMERA

- Change self.bits_depth when color mode is changing in Options menu (to add)

- [CMOS_lab_app_v2]
    - Error when using Settings widget from brand directory (in lensecam) (Update parameters)
    - Error when color mode =/= Mono8 - get_image of camera_ids ?
- [Camera_settings_widget] Not developed for Basler !
