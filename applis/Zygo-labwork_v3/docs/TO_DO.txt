-->     If new acquisition or new data, erase zernike coeff !
-->     Tilt in analyses mode / Update tilt checkbox


Functions
=========
-->     GLOBAL : Hardware - default values for camera and piezo to update
            if hardware is connected
-->     Save mask type in MAT file (and read it)


Bugs
====
-->     main menu management - and options list !
            + if no mask in the data loaded, Masks in main menu is not disponible
-->     in acquisition controllers (and global)
            + find a way to update DEFAULT parameters (for camera and piezo)
            + find a way to stop thread_update camera on closing acquisition mode
-->     in masks controllers / options view
            + uncheck global select if not all the checkbox are selected
-->     in analyses controller
            + colorbar range updating ! multi level displaying
            + colorbar display in 2D surface (when correction is activated) + adapt colorbar of the 2 surfaces 2D
            + unwrapped -> display wrapped and unwrapped in 2D

-->     GLOBAL TEST
            +> main_menu
            +> acquisition mode
                + update default values to camera/piezo parameters
                + update camera parameters when slider changed
            +> images mode
                + when deleting a mask (in masks mode) then back to images mode,
                access to images is not possible (bar with buttons is deleted)
            +> analyses mode
                + when back to analyses mode (if coeffs already calculated), no access to corrected phase
                and progress bar to 0

Test to do
==========
-> Save set of images (with multi acquisition)
-> Display images from multi sets
